### Discord

If you are already on the department's Discord server, you will be given access to the course's Discord channel, called `#programming-languages`. If not, then you will need to join the department's [Discord server](https://discord.gg/alleghenycs) before you can be added to the course's channel.

### Description

Credits: 4

A study of the fundamental concepts that arise in different programming language paradigms. Students learn how programming languages are designed and implemented, and how these factors affect the overall usability, performance, and effectiveness of computer software. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students gain experience in leveraging the styles and features of programming languages to implement and evaluate correct and efficient computer software. During a weekly laboratory session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.

Prerequisite: CMPSC 101.

Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Objectives

1. Recognize various programming language design and implementation trade-offs.
2. Understand fundamental concepts that underlie programming language syntax and semantics.
3. Use language constructs effectively to design correct and elegant programs.
4. Gain exposure to many different languages.
5. Become proficient in writing programs in languages such as Java and C++.
6. Continue developing team-working strategies with a diverse range software developers.
7. Enhance ability to write and present ideas about software in a clear, concise, and compelling fashion.

### Outcomes

At the completion of this class, a student must be comfortable with the fundamental concepts that underlie most programming languages. Students should be moderately experienced in using the different programming styles or paradigms and should be able to choose the appropriate pro- gramming languages for certain classes of problems. Students must be able to develop and apply a strong knowledge of analytical and empirical programming techniques and be able to learn new programming languages with a minimum of effort based on an understanding of general principles of language design and implementation. Finally, students should demonstrate the ability to use both in-person discussions and software tools to collaborate with a group of diverse team members.

### Materials

[Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by Robert Nystrom is the main required textbook for this course. Other reading resources will be provided by the instructor. All reading assignments will be indicated by the instructor with links listed on the [course schedule](#Schedule).

You are required to bring a laptop to every class. Additionally, you will be required to install software on your laptop and if your laptop is not capable of working with specific software then a departmental laptop will be provided to you.

D+            | 67 - 69.9 | D  | 63 - 66.9 | F  | 59.9 and below

#### Class Activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During nearly all class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.

#### Exams

There will be two in-class exams in this course, each worth 10% of the total grade.

The midterm exam is an hour-long cumulative test covering all of the material from the class and laboratory sessions up to the point of the exam. Unless prior arrangements are made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in the stated period of time.

The final examination is a two-hour cumulative test given to students at the end of the academic semester. By enrolling in this course, students agree that, unless there are severe extenuating circumstances, they will take the final examination at the date and time assigned by the college.

#### Lab Assignments

These assignments invite students to explore different techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, testing and documenting software solutions to challenging problems. To best ensure that students are ready to develop software in both other classes at Allegheny and after graduation, students will complete assignments both on an individual basis and in teams. Team-based assignments will be evaluated based on both individual and team effort according to the guidelines established by the members of this course at the beginning of the semester. GatorGrader and Continuous Integration will be used to help students assess their work before submission of the assignment and for the evaluation of the lab assignment.

#### Course project

This project will present you with an opportunity to design and implement a correct and carefully evaluated system for a particular problem using some programming language paradigm. Completion of the final project will require you to apply all of the knowledge and skills that you have acquired during the semester to solve a technical problem and, whenever possible, make your solution and results publicly available in a free and open fashion.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline without severe grade penalty. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded.

#### Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend all of the class and laboratory sessions. There are two types of excused absences: 1) the one you notify the instructor about in advance (for example, if you have a job interview during the class/lab time or have a religious observance), 2) the one that occurs due to a documented emergency or illness. If you will not be able to attend a session, please let the instructor know at least one day in advance to describe your situation. In case you missed a class because of an emergency or an illness, please notify the instructor as soon as possible. In both cases the instructor will work with you to get you caught up. Students who miss more than five unexcused sessions will have their final grade in the course reduced by one letter grade. If you need to miss class due to a religious observance, please speak to me in advance to make appropriate arrangements.

#### Communication

Various digital channels are used in this course for communication, including email, Discord, and the GitHub issue tracker. Additionally, the course website is used to store the link to the course GitHub Organization, which will contain course syllabus, course schedule and the assignments. Students are responsible for regularly checking all platforms to ensure that the important messages are not being missed.

#### Allegheny College Statement of Community

Allegheny College also expects students and faculty to act according to its Statement of Community:

> Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms. This statement does not replace existing personnel policies and codes of conduct.

Keep both of these standards in mind as you exercise your academic inquiry in this course. These serve as our fundamental "first principles" in pursuit of our shared academic goals.

#### Honor Code

All students and faculty at Allegheny College are bound by the Honor Code. Everyone expects that your behavior reflects this commitment. Given the eminently shareable and reproducible nature of code, the Department of Computer Science adds the following statement to the general college policy:

> It is recognized that an important part of the learning process in any course, and particularly in computer science, derives from thoughtful discussions with teachers, student assistants, and fellow students. Such dialogue is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with others, and the student who produces assignments that are identical to, or merely variations on, someone else's work. It will therefore be understood that all assignments submitted to faculty of the Department of Computer Science are to be the original work of the student submitting the assignment, and should be signed in accordance with the provisions of the Honor Code. Appropriate action will be taken when assignments give evidence that they were derived from the work of others.

As the nature of "plagiarism" and constituents of "fair use" change often, the department encourages you to periodically review the specific tenets of the general college Honor Code provided in the latest course catalog and in the _Compass_.

The above statement, of course, also applies to online forums such as Stack Overflow, et al.

#### Classroom Ethics

The discipline of computer science, like many others, encourages its members to act according to discipline-specific ethics. I encourage you to take time to review the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) [Code of Ethics](https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/about/acm-code-of-ethics-booklet.pdf).

In addition, students in this class are required to act within the bounds established by the [Course Community Guidelines](https://github.com/CMPSC-201-Spring2023/course_information/blob/main/community_guidelines.md).

### Assistance

#### Assistance with course concepts

Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor. Students who need the course instructor's assistance should schedule an appointment through her [Office Hour Calendar](https://janyljumadinova.com/schedule).

#### Academic Alerts

Allegheny College uses an Academic Alert system to send progress notices to the class deans in the Maytum Center for Student Success (MCSS). The progress notices are not punitive. They are an opportunity to connect you with your class dean who can offer additional support and suggest resources if you need assistance. These notices may encourage faculty advisors, coaches (for student-athletes), or other support staff to provide outreach to you as well.

#### Class Deans

The Office of Class Deans in Pelletier Library serves as a place for students to begin seeking assistance and answers to their questions related to college life. If you have a question and don't know who to ask - ask a class dean. If you want advice - talk to a class dean. Niki Fjeldal is the First Year Class Dean, Amy Stearns is the Second Year Class Dean / Director of Transfer Advising, and Jonathon May is the Third/Fourth Year Class Dean. Please contact them individually or through studentsuccess@allegheny.edu.

#### Mental Health and Wellness

As a college student, there may be times when personal stressors, struggles, and/or traumas interfere with your academic performance and/or negatively impact your daily life. Allegheny College recognizes that mental health is an important piece of the holistic human experience, and that this experience influences your academic success. We encourage students to prioritize their mental well-being by seeking services and support as needed.

Keep in mind, course deadlines, absences, and accommodations for mental health are subject to the course policies and expectations that are set within this syllabus. Students are encouraged to communicate with their professors as soon as possible regarding their needs and seek support if their mental health impacts their academic performance or daily life. When you find yourself struggling emotionally, remember that there are supports available, and you are not alone.

Students who are in need of mental health support can access free, confidential services and resources in the Counseling and Personal Development Center (CPDC). CPDC delivers holistic mental health services to the Allegheny College student campus community through brief individual and group counseling, crisis support, outreach programming, consultation, and coordination of care. Students may request services by submitting a form on CPDC's website (`sites.allegheny.edu/counseling`). Students may also connect with a mental health clinician at any time by calling Allegheny's 24/7 line: 814-332-2105\.
